This is a place where a I share with the community my experience, and kwowlodge about different topics. My main interest is the aplications of techonology in medecine to develop new techiques of disgnostic to enhace the human health. However, I like other sciences as material science, biochemestry, molecular biology. In addition, my passion is the aplications of mathematics to resolve thoerical physics or real problems with engineering using computation. Currently, I'm a data tech lead at [Clikalia](https://clikalia.com/mx) in Mexico City .
