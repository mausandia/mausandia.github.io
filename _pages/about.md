This is a place where I share with the community my experience and knowledge about different topics. My main interest is the applications of technology in medicine to develop new techniques of diagnostic to enhance the human health. However, I like other sciences like material science, biochemistry, molecular biology. In addition, my passion is the applications of mathematics to resolve theoretical physics or real problems with engineering using computation. Currently, I'm a data tech lead at [Clikalia](https://clikalia.com/mx) in Mexico City.

Portfolio
======
I update my latest personal projects as I develop them. More of them, there are homework or projects from my classes at university or ideas that  I would like to explore with new technologies or new strategies to address real problems.
